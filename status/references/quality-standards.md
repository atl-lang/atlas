# Phase File Quality Standards

All v0.2 phase files follow these standards:
- **DEPENDENCIES section:** Prerequisites checked before starting
- **Exact file paths:** Know exactly what to create/modify
- **Code snippets:** Show actual interfaces and implementations
- **Architecture notes:** Clear direction and integration points
- **Specific test cases:** Not just counts, but what to test
- **Acceptance criteria:** Concrete, measurable success criteria
