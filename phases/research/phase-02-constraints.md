# Phase 02 - Constraints & Risks

## Objective
Explicitly document constraints and potential risks to avoid future refactors.

## Inputs
- `docs/runtime.md`
- `docs/diagnostics.md`

## Deliverables
- Runtime model constraints.
- Diagnostic stability constraints.
- Cross-platform constraints.
- Risk register with mitigations.

## Steps
- List constraints and how they affect implementation.
- Identify risks and proposed mitigations.

## Exit Criteria
- Constraints reviewed and accepted before implementation.
