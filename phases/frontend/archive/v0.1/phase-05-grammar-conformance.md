# Phase 05 - Grammar Conformance

## Objective
Ensure parser implementation matches the EBNF exactly.

## Inputs
- `Atlas-SPEC.md`

## Deliverables
- Conformance checklist mapping EBNF rules to parser functions.
- Tests for operator precedence and associativity.
- Tests for assignment targets (`name =`, `arr[i] =`).

## Steps
- Create a mapping doc of grammar -> parser functions.
- Add tests for tricky precedence cases.

## Exit Criteria
- All grammar rules have passing tests.
