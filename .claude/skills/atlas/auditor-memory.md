# Atlas Doc Auditor — Persistent Memory

**Purpose:** Track recurring drift patterns across audit sessions. Updated by `atlas-doc-auditor`
after each audit run. Helps future auditor sessions know where to look first.

## Recurring Drift Patterns

_Populated by the auditor. Each entry: what drifted, how often, and where to check._

<!-- Format: "FILE | CLAIM TYPE | Drift pattern observed" -->

_(No data yet — will populate after first audit run.)_

## High-Drift Files (updated each audit)

_Files that required edits in the most recent N audits. Check these first._

| File | Last Modified | Drift Type |
|------|--------------|------------|
